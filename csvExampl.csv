Are you ready to take on real world issues? Are you ready to put in the hard work to build the grassroots support we need to protect the environment or take on powerful special interests? As a canvasser, that’s what you’ll do. You'll go out into communities, knock on doors and speak with people to raise awareness, support and money for the campaigns we’re working on, all while learning the skills you’d need to take on almost any challenge.
Make change happen.
We all want to make a difference. But wanting change, or hoping for it, or even passionately arguing for it isn’t enough. If we want to see real progress, we need to do more. When change does happen, the president or the governor usually gets the headline. Yet, the real action takes place behind the scenes, with hundreds or thousands or even millions of people across the country making their voices heard through petitions, emails, donations and meetings. That’s people power, and that’s what you’ll build with the Fund.
Find out what it takes to win.
We’ve been running grassroots campaigns across the country since 1982. Over the last 30 years, we’ve worked on behalf of U.S. PIRG, Environment America, and others on a wide range of issues in all parts of the country. Our canvassers have gathered more than 20 million petition signatures, and we’ve raised more than $500 million to help these groups win their campaigns.","Austin, TX",https://www.simplyhired.com/serp/imgM1wxlgmJz6bcGyhWs5Z5VHWXjIwG7i7luTo_6_OyUZBtZgyjNfWWBMUvRNTUlOEXk2iC7RT2Uo7vSEDWpgvYqw-pCnBlaoyiliveXraA-XPSJNlv2gjliffInsgY77S7wsD8xt2qRGPWT6SvMxVd-3GfhAI,Nonprofit Environmental Campaign Citizen Outreach,"Estimated: ,$39,000 - $52,000 a year"

They say artists have to suffer for their art to be great. We disagree.
Friend That Cooks Personal Chef Service has a dual mission. We have a service that improves the quality of life for both our clients AND our chefs. We don't believe you should have to sacrifice your evenings and weekends to make a career out of cooking. We don't believe in 6-7 day work weeks and 12-16 hour shifts. We don't believe great cooks should spend their career forced to prepare other chef's recipes, use sub-par ingredients or work in high pressure environments that prevent you from leaving your work at the workplace.
If you have a culinary degree (or can demonstrate equivalent knowledge), own a reliable vehicle, have a smart phone and know how to use it, are great with people, and have a huge repertoire of ethnically diverse dishes you can make from scratch without recipes, WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
Our personal chefs work mainly weekday hours from 8'ish to 5'ish. Evening and weekend opportunities occasionally arise, are optional, and pay automatic overtime. Our chefs start part-time at $19/hour plus some benefits, then advance to $20/hour and full benefits when their schedule reaches full time. They get creative freedom with their food (within the tastes and diet restrictions of their clients). They also have the best work environment in the food service industry.
The primary job of a Friend That Cooks chef is to provide in-home weekly meal prep to our clients. Our client's homes are our job site. Our chefs plan their menus, shop, cook on-site, clean up and stock their refrigerators with a week's worth of creative, delicious, prepared meals to reheat.
To be one of our chefs, you'll need to pass an intensive interview process that includes culinary knowledge and cooking tests. The right candidate will start part time at $19/hour and enjoy the benefits listed below:
Automatic raise to $20/hour upon reaching a full schedule (full time)Automatic overtime for parties and cooking lessons (part and full time)Pay for optional holiday parties up to 3x hourly rate (part time and full time)Occasional tips (part and full time)Unrestricted flex pay for holidays, sick and personal days (full time)401k with company contribution (part and full time)Heavily subsidized health/dental/vision insurance (full time)Paid maternity/paternity leave (part and full time)Equipment allowance (part and full time)Gas reimbursements (part and full time)Generous referral rewards for referring chefs and clients (part time and full time)Free uniforms (part time and full time)
We require two weeks of training, possibly requiring travel to another city which we pay for. There is no selling involved on your part. We provide all your clients and you get to focus on what you were born to do, creating and cooking.

The recruiting world is being defined all the time. Below are some definitions of the word ""affiliate"", ""importer"", and ""exporter"" in the world of virtual recruiting.
Consider the following exampleLet's say you are an agency (Agency A). Agency A has a job to fill and you need candidates to fill the job. Agency A has two main options in finding candidates. They can either try to fill it on their own - with their own recruiting staff and resources. Or Agency A can seek the services to use the services of another firm or individual to help them in their search for candidates. This other firm or individual, I'll call Agency B.
So in the example above, Agency A is an affiliate to Agency B. At the same time Agency B is an affiliate to Agency A. They are affiliates to each other because, they are using another entity to either help find candidates (Agency B) or to find a job requirement that needs to be filled (Agency A).
The entity that has the job is called the importer. Agency A is the importer in the example above, because they are the ones providing the job that needs to be filled.
Agency B is the exporter because they are the one providing candidates for the job.

It’s our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time — and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.

Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we’ll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it’s really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.

About Austin
Austin is a vibrant city filled with a rich cultural heritage and is ranked as the #1 Best Place to Live for the second year in a row by U.S. News and World Report. The city of Austin is the state capital and holds the ranking as the 11th largest city in the United States. Currently, Austin is home to 16 of IDEA’s schools and serves nearly 7,800 students at campuses in Austin, Kyle, and Pflugerville.

This is why we focus on AP courses for all students, college acceptance, and matriculation. Only 1 in 8 Austin students graduate college ready. Changing this statistic is part of the promise IDEA makes to current and incoming students.
