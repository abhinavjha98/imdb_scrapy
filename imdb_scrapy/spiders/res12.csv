Selected students will be eligible to complete an international rotation at their choice of one of over 200 worldwide office locations. Visit sap.com/careers/starprogram to learn more.

Job Description Summary
Job Description
The TURBO (Transforming and Unifying Research with Biomedical Ontologies) group seeks a software developer/engineer to join our team of ontologists and programmers to help create a novel suite of graph database applications. Ontologies and graph databases are part of an exciting new movement in information technology that elevates data to the level of knowledge. The technologies in this space are just beginning to gather steam. As a result, there is significant opportunity to make an impact in what will likely become a popular field in informatics. The base server side technology for ontologies and graph databases is Java, so we will likely write tool sets and applications in Java and JVM languages like Groovy and Scala. Automated testing will be a key component of all code produced by TURBO. We are developing tools that will assist ontologists in transforming discrete data to ontologized forms with assured correctness (see https://authors.elsevier.com/sd/article/S2590-177X (20)30021-4). We are working with the Penn Health system to provide graph-based tools for searching clinical data by researchers in efficient and adaptive ways. We work on open-source projects ( https://github.com/PennTURBO ) to provide innovative tools for the biomedical research community.
This position offers the opportunity to interact with leading medical investigators, ontology experts, and skilled programmers in a university and health system setting. TURBO programmers are encouraged to take advantage of the University tuition reimbursement program and pursue an advanced degree while contributing to an active and evolving area of technology.
Position is contingent upon funding.
Bachelor's degree in computer information science, software engineering, or a related field of study required and a minimum of 1 to 3 years of software development experience preferred or an equivalent combination of education and experience. The combination of education and experience should provide a strong foundation in application design and development.
